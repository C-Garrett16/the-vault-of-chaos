### Quick Commands

- `git init` - Initialize the current folder for version control.
- `git add` - Stages specific files for committal. (Use dot notation to stage all changes)
- `git commit` - Commit your staged files. This is the last step before pushing. 
	- You can add a committal message here by using the -m flag.
- `git push` - Finally, this command pushes your committed changes to the remote. In this case, the remote will be a Gitlab repository. ^Remote-Repository
