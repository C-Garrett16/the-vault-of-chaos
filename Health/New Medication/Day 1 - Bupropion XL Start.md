- Focus: Sharpened mid-morning, scattered later

- Irritability: None
    

## Physical Symptoms

- Dry mouth: Mild
    
- Dizziness: Yes, especially mid-morning after walking/fasting
    
- Shortness of breath: Mild, tied to anxious stimulation—not respiratory distress
    
- Appetite: Returned strongly after initial energy spike wore off
    
- Fatigue: Noticeable by afternoon despite regular meals
    
- Sleepiness: Present in afternoon despite no caffeine crash
    

## Medication Reactions

- Sertraline: No new effects
    
- Bupropion XL 150mg: Immediate noticeable stimulant-like effects
    
- Combined: Wired/focused early on, tapered to tired but calm
    

## Nutrition & Hydration

- Breakfast: Banana + 8oz water
    
- Lunch: Subway 6" Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki, baked chips, Gatorade
    
- Fluids: Gatorade, 8oz water, small mocha (dark roast)
    
- Snacking: Ongoing hydration + intention to snack this evening
    
- Observations: Felt genuine hunger cues for the first time in a while
    

## Behavior / Notable Events

- Walked a lot during early “buzz” period
    
- Described feeling like "could run a marathon"
    
- Skipped coffee early; had small mocha later to prevent caffeine headache
    
- Ate consistently for the first time in a while
    
- Felt tired, sluggish late afternoon; possible dopamine burnout or adjustment dip
    

## Alcohol & Caffeine Consideration

- No alcohol consumed (intentionally avoided)
    
- Mocha caffeine: ~80–100mg total, tolerated well
    
- Plan to avoid alcohol during first few days of med adjustment
    

## Reflections

- Body responded very strongly to first dose, both physically and mentally
    
- Initial dopamine surge likely caused overactivity followed by energy dip
    
- Sluggishness is likely part of adjustment process, not failure
    
- Eating regularly helped regulate crash and dizziness
    
- Overall, Day 1 felt intense but survivable
    

## Plan for Tomorrow

- Eat a full breakfast (banana + toast or protein)
    
- Stick with water/Gatorade, hold back on full caffeine unless needed
    
- Avoid alcohol again
    
- Watch for return of dizziness or anxious energy
    
- Log mood, focus, appetite, and sleep in Day 2 entry
