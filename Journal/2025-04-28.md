- [ ]

## What Happened:
- We went to another doctors appointment for Toya. Everything is okay so far. We didn't do an ultrasound, but we go to the high risk doctors on the 12th. We'll get way more details then, plus the anatomy scan. She did some kind of blood test to check on the problem that happened last year. Can't wait to see Eren again.

## Brain Dump / Random Thoughts:
- Listening to the radio today, some sad songs that came on made me think of Taylor and our time together again. Seems as though when I do get a bit sad on this medicine, it makes it a bit worse? Will need to talk to the doctor about that. [[Notes For Doctor Raulston]]

- Thinking about switching to tea from coffee since it seems to keep my headaches away and keep me mellow. I want to research some more on tea, and see what I can keep in stock to make thinks I like. I love London Fogs. [[Tea The Next Generation]]

## People I Need to Deal With / Talk To:
- Most of the people over at the Hospital is really nice. However, the nurse who done her triage didn't seem to like her job very much. Resting bitch face.

## Gratitude / Small Wins:
- Drinking tea (Earl Grey) seems to have a better affect on me than the coffee. No headaches and I seem a bit more chill. Good things.
