## What Happened:
- This morning I actually ate some overnight oats, so that was good. 
- I feel like dog shit. I need to do better 
- As always, I catch my second wind the closer it gets to dark. Dunno why. I blame being an introvert vampire.
- I made it.

## Brain Dump / Random Thoughts:
- Getting back into Linux after a hiatus. Im actually backing up my dotfiles using Git. Need to make a note with all the Git commands and the order in which to use them. [[Coming to Grips with Git]]

## People I Need to Deal With / Talk To:
- A bunch of damn Elementary kids doing a Lion King play in Guerry. They actually put a lav on a kid. It worked out fine, but still. This was only rehearsal and they want to use everything under the sun. This is going to be interesting.

## Gratitude / Small Wins:
- I took a nap in the car. Feel better. Taking the W. Especially after my chaotic sleep schedule.
- I ate breakfast this morning.
