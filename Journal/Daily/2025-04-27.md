## What Happened:
- No coffee today. I was going to go get the Monster Java that Tiffany got the other day from mamas, but they're probably still asleep. Plus, I need to work on not drinking so much caffeine, so I went with tea.

## Brain Dump / Random Thoughts:
- Finally getting a day that I can do whatever I want since I've been working so much. So I'm pretty happy about that. Just me today. No work, no chores. Just bliss.
- I actually ate breakfast today. Maybe a start of something better?
- Will I actually use this? Maybe.
-  I need to pull up what I did in ChatGPT for my DND campaign. I created a new language that I want to use in it. - [[Language of the People.]]
- What kind of world do I want it to be? Most likely fantasy. - [[Worldbuilding]]
