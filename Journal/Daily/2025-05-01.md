## What Happened:
- starting off the day, 2 hours of sleep, no breakfast. At least I have caffeine. Let's see where this goes. 
- Well it went. All that's left is the ride home. After I let Guerry clear out anyway. 

## Brain Dump / Random Thoughts:
- I'm thinking of ditching Facebook. I'm tired of the doom scrolling. Gonna devote more time to this probably. We'll see. At least this is more productive. 
- the walk from Guerry to the office was a very relaxing walk even though I'm about to fall over from exhaustion. Poem or short story idea? [[The Walk Back]]

## People I Need to Deal With / Talk To:
- The Sewanee Elementary play is today. They're doing the Lion King. Which.. well this is gonna be fun. 
- it actuality wasn't too bad believe it or not. Now to decide to go home or stay here for a bit. 

## Gratitude / Small Wins:
- Pay day is tomorrow, so I don't have to do without. Im definitely getting me some beer though after this week. It's been hell. 
- I think I made it. At least I made it through the SES Play. That's a win right?
