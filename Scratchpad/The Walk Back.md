Poem or short story. 

Peaceful, slightly melancholy, mellow

Breathing without noticing. Mind - relaxed? Almost like.. debriefing after a long hard day. Unattended. Almost like a warm sip of tea that honey has slowly desentigrated into. A gigantic sigh of relief even though I didn't sigh. Somehow that walk felt like that. 

Weightless, yet feeling the weight of the world start to crack and crumble. Slowly but surely, relief.
