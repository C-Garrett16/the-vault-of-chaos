**Caffeine Level:** **None** / Low / Medium / High
Lots of floral notes with this one. Very earthy and good on it's own with a bit of sugar. The mouthfeel is smooth, and no real aftertaste.

### Mood
Need to try this one more. I hadn't ate anything really this day so it was on an empty stomach. I didn't notice any irritation or anything. I seemed calm, but I think another test would be needed. The Brand was Rishi. Really wanna try that again.
