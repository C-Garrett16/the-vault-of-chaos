## Overview
**Caffeine Level:** Low / **==Medium==** / High
Smooth, inviting, and warming. The Earl Grey pairs really well with the honey and milk. An optional add in would be **caramel**. You get floral notes from the Earl Grey, which will obviously pair well with the honey. Match made in heaven.

## Recipe:
- Earl Grey
- Steamed Milk
- Honey

### Mood
- It keeps me level throughout the day. No headaches from the low caffeine dosage that I've noticed. It seems to settle my stomach as well. Doesn't make me immediately go to the bathroom. Probably not one to have multiple of though. ^mood-log
